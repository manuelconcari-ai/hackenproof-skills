# HackenProof Program Report Generator

Generate a structured summary report for all reports in a HackenProof program. The output is a self-contained file (Markdown, JSON, or CSV) ready to share or archive.

## Prerequisites

The export uses program discovery and pagination calls, followed by one detail call per report. Permission prompts depend on the user's Claude Code configuration.

For optional pre-approval of the MCP reads used below, tell the user they can merge these entries into `permissions.allow` in the project's `.claude/settings.local.json`; preserve existing settings. The example assumes the server is named `hackenproof`. Verify the configured server and tool names before using it.

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "mcp__hackenproof__list_companies",
      "mcp__hackenproof__list_programs",
      "mcp__hackenproof__get_program_info",
      "mcp__hackenproof__list_reports",
      "mcp__hackenproof__get_report_details"
    ]
  }
}
```

These five tools cover Steps 1, 3, and 4. `get_report_details` with `full=true` supplies comments and attachment filenames; no separate comment or attachment fetch is needed. Reading the Markdown template and writing the output file use local file tools and their own permissions.

`.claude/settings.local.json` applies to one project, and Claude Code keeps it out of git when it creates the file; a hand-written one needs its own `.gitignore` entry. The same five entries also work in `~/.claude/settings.json` for a user who wants one grant across projects: the narrowing, not the file, is what matters here.

Do not add `mcp__hackenproof__*` or the equivalent server-wide rule `mcp__hackenproof`: both can also cover write tools. If either was added for export, remove it from every settings file where `/permissions` lists it, including `~/.claude/settings.json`. Permission lists merge across files, so adding a narrower local list does not revoke an existing broad grant.

This example adds no write-tool grants. Other permission rules, hooks, managed policies, tool-specific interaction requirements, and the active permission mode still determine whether a call prompts, runs, or is denied. The triage skills' explicit user-confirmation requirement remains applicable; this allowlist is not a guarantee of a human prompt before writes.

If read calls still require approval, explain before starting Step 4:

> "This program has {N} reports, requiring {N} detail calls after discovery and pagination. You can approve reads as prompted or optionally use the five exact read-tool entries above. Shall I proceed?"

Only proceed after the user confirms.

## When to Use

- When a user asks for a summary, final, or export report of a program's reports
- When a user wants to save or share the state of all reports in a program
- When a user triggers with phrases like: "export all reports", "generate md file for all program reports", "final report for my program", "make a full report export", "export program reports"

## Workflow

### Step 1: Resolve Program

If the user provided a program slug or URL — use it directly.

If not:
1. Call `list_companies` to get all companies.
2. For each company, call `list_programs` to enumerate programs.
3. Show the user a numbered list:

```
Available programs:

  1. near-intents  (company: near-protocol)
  2. bluefin-dex   (company: bluefin)
  ...

Which program should I generate the report for?
```

Wait for selection before proceeding.

### Step 2: Ask for Report Type and Format

Present the options to the user:

```
Which report type do you want?

  1. Full — all available data (title, description, severity, state, PoC, attachments, comments, team info)
  2. No Comments — same as Full but without comments thread
  3. Public — no comments and no team/assignee information (safe to share externally)

Type 1, 2, or 3 (default: 1):
```

Then ask for output format:

```
Which output format do you want?

  1. Markdown (.md) — formatted report
  2. JSON (.json) — structured data
  3. CSV (.csv) — spreadsheet-ready

Type 1, 2, or 3 (default: 1):
```

Wait for both selections. Defaults: report type **1 (Full)**, format **1 (Markdown)**.

Map selections:
- Report type: `1` → `mode: full`, `2` → `mode: no-comments`, `3` → `mode: public`
- Format: `1` → `format: md`, `2` → `format: json`, `3` → `format: csv`

### Step 3: Fetch All Reports

1. Call `get_program_info` for the selected program — extract `title` (program display name), `company`, and program slug.
2. Call `list_reports` with `page=1`. If 10 results are returned, fetch subsequent pages until exhausted.
3. Collect the full list of report IDs and basic metadata (id, title, severity, state).

### Step 4: Fetch Report Details

**Always use `get_report_details` with `full=true` for every report individually.**

Do NOT use `get_reports_details_batch` — it returns incomplete `labels` data (known limitation: returns empty array even when labels exist). Only `get_report_details` with `full=true` returns accurate labels and all fields including comments in a single call.

Fetch reports in parallel where possible to reduce total time.

> **CRITICAL — do not return to the user between Step 4 and Step 5.** All fetched data lives only in the active context window and is lost on compaction. Immediately proceed to Step 5 (write the file) in the same response turn, without asking the user anything or waiting for confirmation.

For each report, collect:

**Always fetched (all modes):**
- Report ID and URL (`https://dashboard.hackenproof.com/manager/companies/{company}/{program}/reports/{id}`)
- Title
- Severity
- State
- Target / asset
- CVSS score (if present)
- Labels (accurate only from `get_report_details`)
- Description
- Steps to reproduce
- Attachments list (filenames only, not content)
- Submitted date (`created_at`)
- Published date (`published_at`)
- Last updated date
- SLA status

**Only in `mode: full`:**
- Comments (already included in `get_report_details` with `full=true` — no separate `get_comments` call needed)

> **Known API limitations (as of 2026-05-02):** The following fields are visible in the HackenProof dashboard but not currently returned by the API:
> - **Comment attachments** — each comment has an `attachments` field but it always returns `[]` even when files are attached. In the report, note `*(attachments not available via API)*` if the comment is known to have files.
> - **Assignee** — the user assigned to triage the report is not returned.
> - **Participants / Team members** — managers participating in the report thread are not returned as a separate field.
> - **Bounty / reward per report** — actual payout is not returned (only program-level reward ranges via `get_program_info`).
> - **Program status** — Draft / Published / Private visibility is not returned.

### Step 5: Generate Report

Use the template from `references/report-template.md` for Markdown output.

Build the document in this order:
1. Cover page
2. Table of contents (auto-generated from report IDs and titles) — includes columns: #, ID, Title, Severity, State, Author, Created on (DD.MM.YYYY — date only, no time)
3. One section per report, sorted by report ID from newest to oldest (descending by submission date; for same-date reports, sort by numeric ID descending)

Write the final output to a single file in the current directory (use the Write tool):

**If `format: md`:**
`{program-slug}-report-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`

**If `format: json`:**
`{program-slug}-report-{YYYY-MM-DD}.json`

Structure:
```json
{
  "program": "{program-slug}",
  "company": "{company}",
  "generated": "{YYYY-MM-DD}",
  "mode": "{full|no-comments|public}",
  "total": N,
  "reports": [
    {
      "id": "...",
      "url": "...",
      "title": "...",
      "severity": "...",
      "state": "...",
      "author": "...",
      "target": "...",
      "cvss": "...",
      "submitted": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "published": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "last_updated": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "sla": "...",
      "labels": [],
      "description": "...",
      "steps_to_reproduce": "...",
      "impact": "...",
      "attachments": [],
      "comments": []
    }
  ]
}
```
- In `mode: public` omit `comments` array and `author` field.
- In `mode: no-comments` omit `comments` array.

**If `format: csv`:**
`{program-slug}-report-{YYYY-MM-DD}.csv`

Columns (header row first):
```
"ID","Title","Severity","State","Author","Target","CVSS","Submitted","Last Updated","Labels","URL"
```
- Wrap all values in double quotes.
- For multi-value fields (labels), join with ` | `.
- Dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- Null/missing values → `N/A`.

After writing the file, confirm to the user:
```
Report saved to: {filename}
Reports included: {count}
Mode: {Full | No Comments | Public}
Format: {Markdown | JSON | CSV}
```

## Output Rules

- Always include the cover page — never skip it (Markdown only).
- Table of contents must list every report with an anchor link (Markdown only).
- Sort reports by submission date descending (newest first). For reports submitted on the same date, sort by numeric ID descending (e.g. DSC-52 before DSC-50).
- In `mode: public`, strip all fields listed under "Only in full / no-comments" above — no assignee, no triager, no internal labels.
- In `mode: no-comments`, include assignee and labels but omit the comments section entirely.
- Never fabricate data — if a field is empty or not returned by the API, write `N/A`.
- Do not include raw JSON from API responses — format everything as clean Markdown.
- Attachments: list filenames only (not content). Do not call `fetch_attachment`.
- If the program has more than 50 reports, warn the user that generation may take a moment before starting Step 4.

## Error Handling

- If `list_reports` returns 0 results, stop and tell the user: "No reports found for program `{slug}`. Nothing to generate."
- If `get_program_info` fails, still proceed using the program slug as the display name.
- If `get_report_details` fails for a specific report, note the failure in the report section and continue with remaining reports.
